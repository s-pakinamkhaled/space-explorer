#  Space Explorer

**Space Explorer** is a Node.js-based web application that connects to various public space APIs to provide real-time astronomical data. It showcases NASAâ€™s Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD), the current location of the International Space Station (ISS), and a list of upcoming space launches. This project was developed with modularity, testing, and extensibility in mind.

- ** ISS Location Tracker**: Provides the real-time latitude and longitude of the ISS.
